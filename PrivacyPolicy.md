# Privacy Policy for Haptics Toggle

> Last Updated: January 19, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how Liam peters ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use the Haptics Toggle mobile application (the "App").

### Information Collection and Use
   
We believe in absolute privacy.

No Personal Data: The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, location, or device identifiers.

No Data Transmission: No data is ever sent from your device to our servers or any third parties.

### Permissions and Their Purpose

The App requires the "Modify System Settings" (WRITE_SETTINGS) permission for one specific purpose:

To allow you to toggle the system-wide vibration and haptics setting via the Quick Settings tile.

The App only interacts with the vibration/haptic feedback setting. It does not access, modify, or read any other system settings or user data.

### Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking tools.

### Children's Privacy

Because we do not collect any data, our App is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
